# Calculator (TDD Practice)

Fork this repo and clone it.

Run the tests.

```ruby calculator_test.rb```

One test should pass, one should fail.

**Next steps:**

//1. Fix the first failing test by implementing the subtract method.
//2. Make sure your code works by running the tests again.
//3. Write the multiply _test_ (don't implement the multiply method yet).
//4. Run the tests again. Your new test should fail.
//5. Now you can implement the multiply method
//6. Run the tests to make sure your code works.
7. Add + commit your changes.
8. Repeat steps 3 - 7 to implement: divide, multiply, square
